# DIY-Christmas
Arduino UNO code for a project created using the Elegoo Super Starter Kit's supplies.
The project utilized an LCD Display, 4 groups of LEDs, and a passive buzzer that played music.
We had a lot of fun working on this project as a final, and I hope some people can play around with their arduino kits!
